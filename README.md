# India-Covid-19-Vaccination-Data-Analysis
In this analysis, I have used pandas, matplotlib and numpy to visualize and calculate the number of people taken vaccination in different states of India on the basis of doses, gender, age, types of vaccine and adverse effects after vaccine with the help of charts like line chart, bar chart, pie chart etc.
